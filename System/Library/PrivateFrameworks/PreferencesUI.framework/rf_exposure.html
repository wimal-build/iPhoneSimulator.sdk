    <body>
        <p>iPhone has been tested and meets applicable limits for Radio Frequency (RF) exposure.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) refers to the rate at which the body absorbs RF energy. Mobile phone SAR limits are 1.6 watts per kilogram (over a volume containing a mass of 1 gram of tissue) in countries that follow the United States FCC standard and 2.0 watts per kilogram (averaged over 10 grams of tissue) in countries that follow the Council of the European Union standard. During testing, iPhone radios are set to their highest transmission levels and placed in positions that simulate use against the head, with no separation, and near the body, with 10 mm separation.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>To reduce exposure to RF energy, decrease talk time or use a hands-free option, such as the built-in speakerphone, the supplied headphones, or other similar accessories. Carry iPhone at least 10 mm away from your body to ensure exposure levels remain at or below maximum levels. Avoid cases with metal parts.</p>
