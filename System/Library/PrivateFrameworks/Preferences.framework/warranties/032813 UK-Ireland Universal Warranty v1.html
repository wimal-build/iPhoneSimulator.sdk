<br>
Following warranty service, your Apple Product or a replacement product will be returned to you as your Apple Product was configured when originally sold, subject to applicable updates. Apple may install system software updates as part of warranty service that will prevent the Apple Product from reverting to an earlier version of the system software. Third party applications installed on the Apple Product may not be compatible or work with the Apple Product as a result of the system software update. You will be responsible for reinstalling all other software programs, data and information. Recovery and reinstallation of other software programs, data and information are not covered under this warranty.<br>
<br>
You may seek service in a country that is not the country of purchase, in such a case you will comply with all applicable import and export laws and regulations and be responsible for all custom duties, V.A.T. and other associated taxes and charges. <br>
<br>
<b>Important: Do not open the Apple Product unless the User Manual describes how it is designed for opening. Opening the Apple Product may cause damage that is not covered by this warranty.</b><br>
<br>
<span class="s1"><b>WHAT WILL APPLE DO IN THE EVENT OF A WARRANTY CLAIM?<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>(i) repair</b> the Apple Product using new or previously used parts that are equivalent to new in performance and reliability, or <br>
<br>

<br>
</b>When a product or part is replaced or a refund provided, any replacement item becomes your property and the replaced or refunded item becomes Apple's property.<br>
<br>
A replacement part or product or a repaired Apple Product assumes the remaining warranty of the original Apple Product or ninety (90) days from the date of replacement or repair, whichever provides longer coverage for you. <br>
<br>
For service requested in a country other than the country of purchase for the Apple Product, Apple may repair or replace products and parts with comparable products and parts that comply with local standards.<br>

<br>
If you do not have internet access or the Apple Product is still not functioning properly after making use of these resources, please contact an Apple representative or, if applicable, an Apple owned retail store (“Apple Retail”) or an AASP, and they will help determine whether your Apple Product requires service and, if it does, will inform you in which of the warranty service options set out below Apple will provide it. <br>
<br>
Before receiving warranty service, Apple or its agents may require that you furnish proof of purchase details, respond to questions designed to assist with diagnosing potential issues and follow Apple's procedures for obtaining warranty service, such as following instructions for packing and shipping Apple Products when receiving Mail-in service as described below. <br>
<br>
You will not need to prove that the nonconformity complained of existed at the date of delivery to obtain service and support under the Apple One-Year Limited Warranty, unless this would be incompatible with the nature of the non-conformity.<br>
<br>
<span class="s1"><b>WARRANTY SERVICE OPTIONS<br>
<br>
</b></span>Apple will at its option depending on the individual circumstances, in particular the type of Apple Product, provide warranty service through one or more of the following options:<br>
<br>
<b>(i) Carry-in service.</b> Apple may request that you return your Apple Product to an Apple Retail or AASP location offering carry-in service. Your Apple Product may be sent to an Apple Repair Service (“ARS”) location to be serviced. Once you are notified that service is complete, you will promptly retrieve the Apple Product from the Apple Retail or AASP location, or the Apple Product will be sent directly to your location from the ARS location.<br>
<br>
<b>(ii) Mail-in service.</b> If Apple elects to provide service through its mail-in service, Apple will send you prepaid waybills and if applicable, packaging material, so that you may ship your Apple Product to an ARS or AASP location in accordance with Apple’s instructions. Once service is complete, the ARS or AASP location will return the Apple Product to you. Apple will pay for shipping to and from your location if all instructions are followed.<br>
<br>
<b>(iii) Do-it-yourself (“DIY”) service.</b> Under DIY service Apple will provide you with a replacement product or easily replaceable parts or accessories of a product, such as a mouse or keyboard, which can be replaced without using any tools.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><span class="s1">Note:</span> Apple is not responsible for any labour costs you incur relating to DIY service. Should you require further assistance with the replacement, contact Apple at the telephone number listed below, or visit an Apple Retail or AASP location. If Apple elects to provide service through DIY service, the following process will apply: <br>
<br>
(a) Service where Apple requires return of the replaced product, part or accessory: Apple may require a credit card authorization as security for the retail price of the replacement product, part or accessory and applicable shipping costs. Apple will ship a replacement product, part or accessory to you with instructions for replacement, if applicable, and any requirements for the return of the replaced product or part. If you follow the instructions, Apple will cancel the credit card authorization, so you will not be charged for the product or part and shipping to and from your location. If you fail to return the replaced product, part or accessory as instructed or return a replaced product, part or accessory that is ineligible for service, Apple will charge your credit card for the authorized amount. If you are unable to provide credit card authorization, the service may not be available to you and Apple will offer alternative arrangements for service.<br>
<br>
(b) Service where Apple does not require return of the replaced product, part or accessory: Apple will ship you free of charge a replacement product, part or accessory accompanied by instructions on installation, if applicable, and any requirements for the disposal of the replaced product, part or accessory. <br>
