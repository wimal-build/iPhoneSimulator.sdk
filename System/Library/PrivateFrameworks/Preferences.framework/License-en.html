<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">(c) To the extent that Apple has preinstalled Apple-branded apps from the App Store on your iOS Device at the time of purchase (“Preinstalled Apps”), you will need to log into the App Store and associate these Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account in order to use them on your iOS Device. When you associate a Preinstalled App with your App Store account, you will at the same time be automatically associating all other Preinstalled Apps on your iOS Device. By choosing to associate the Preinstalled Apps with your App Store account, you agree that Apple may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use both the Apple ID used by your App Store account and a unique hardware identifier collected from your iOS Device, as unique account identifiers for the purpose of verifying the eligibility of your request and providing you access to the Preinstalled Apps through the App Store.

<p class="p1"><b>4. Consent to Use of Data.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p1">(a) <span class="s1">Diagnostic and Usage Data.</span><b> </b>If you opt in to diagnostic and usage collection, you agree that Apple and its subsidiaries and agents may collect, maintain, process and use diagnostic, technical, usage and related information (“Diagnostic and Usage Data”), including but not limited to unique system or hardware identifiers, information about your iOS Device, computer, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to provide and improve Apple’s products and services, facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to the iOS Software, and to verify compliance with the terms of this License. Apple may use this information, as long as it is collected in a form that does not personally identify you, for the purposes described above. If you have opted in and have Location Services turned on, the location of your device may also be sent to help Apple analyze wireless or cellular performance issues (e.g. the strength or weakness of a cellular signal in a particular location). To enable Apple’s partners, third party developers and content providers to improve their software, hardware, courses, materials, and services designed for use with Apple products, Apple may also provide any such party with a subset of Diagnostic and Usage Data that is relevant to that party’s software, hardware, courses, materials and/or services, as long as the Diagnostic and Usage Data is in a form that does not personally identify you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">(b) <span class="s1">Location Data</span>.

<p class="p1">(c) <span class="s1">Siri and Dictation</span>. If your iOS Device supports Siri and Dictation, these features may allow you to make requests, give commands and dictate text to your device using your voice. When you use Siri or Dictation, the things you say will be recorded and sent to Apple in order to convert what you say into text and to process your requests. Your device will also send Apple other information, such as your name and nickname; the names, nicknames, and relationship with you (e.g., “my dad”) of your address book contacts; song names in your collection, and HomeKit-enabled devices in your home (e.g., “living room lights”) (collectively, your “User Data”). All of this data is used to help Siri and Dictation understand you better and recognize what you say. It is not linked to other data that Apple may have from your use of other Apple services. <b>By using Siri or Dictation, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input and User Data, to provide and improve Siri, Dictation, and dictation functionality in other Apple products and services.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">(f) <span class="s1">Maps</span>. The maps service and features of the iOS Software (“Maps”), including map data coverage, may vary by region. When you use any location-based features within Maps, such as turn-by-turn navigation, traffic and local search, various location-related and usage information may be sent to Apple, including the real-time geographic location of your iOS Device, in order to process your request and help improve Maps. Such location and usage data is collected by Apple in a form that does not personally identify you. <b>By using Maps, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, to provide and improve the Maps features and service, and other Apple products and services.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You may disable the location-based functionality of Maps by going to the Location Services setting on your iOS Device and turning off the individual location setting for Maps. Certain Maps features will however be unavailable if you disable the Location Services setting, such as turn-by-turn navigation.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">(g) <span class="s1">Interest-Based Advertising from iAd</span>. Apple may provide mobile, interest-based advertising to you. If you do not want to receive relevant ads on your iOS Device, you can opt out by going to the Limit Ad Tracking setting on your iOS Device. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to the content on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">(h) <span class="s1">Spotlight; Spotlight Suggestions in Safari</span>. When you use Spotlight or Spotlight Suggestions in Safari, your search queries, the Spotlight Suggestions you select, and related usage data will be sent to Apple. When using Spotlight, search results found on your device will not be sent to Apple. If you have Location Services turned on, when you make a search query to Spotlight the location of your iOS Device at that time will be sent to Apple. Location, search queries, and usage information sent to Apple will be used by Apple only to make Spotlight Suggestions more relevant and to improve other Apple products and services. <b>By using Spotlight or Spotlight Suggestions in Safari, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information to make Spotlight Suggestions more relevant and to improve other Apple products and services.</b></p>
