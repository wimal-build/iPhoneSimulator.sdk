<h3>Search Engine Suggestions</h3>
<p>Safari has one field for searches and web addresses so you can browse the web from one convenient place. When Search Engine Suggestions are enabled, Safari will ask your selected search engine for suggestions based on what you&rsquo;ve typed.</p>

<h3>Spotlight Suggestions</h3>
<p>When you use Spotlight Suggestions in Safari, your search queries, the Spotlight Suggestions you select, and related usage data will be sent to Apple. If you have Location Services on your device turned on, when you make a search query to Spotlight the location of your device at that time will be sent to Apple. Location, search queries, and usage information sent to Apple will be used by Apple only to make Spotlight Suggestions more relevant and to improve other Apple products and services.</p>

<p>If you do not want your Safari search queries and Spotlight Suggestions usage data sent to Apple, you can change your privacy settings for Safari at any time. To do so, open Settings, tap Safari, scroll down to Privacy &amp; Security and choose the options you wish to enable or disable.</p>

<p>You can turn off Location Services for Spotlight Suggestions. To do so, open Settings, tap Privacy, tap Location Services, tap System Services, and slide the Spotlight Suggestions switch to “off”. If you turn off Location Services on your device, your precise location will not be sent to Apple. To deliver relevant search suggestions, Apple may use the IP address of your Internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region.</p>

<p>Information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy">www.apple.com/uk/privacy</a>.</p>

<h3>Preload Top Hit</h3>
<p>With Preload Top Hit enabled, as soon as Safari determines a Top Hit based on your bookmarks and browsing history, Safari will begin loading the webpage in the background. If you disable this option, the page will load normally.</p>
