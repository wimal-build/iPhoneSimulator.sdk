<h3>Search Engine Suggestions</h3>
<p>Safari has one field for searches and web addresses so you can browse the web from one convenient place. When Search Engine Suggestions are enabled, Safari will ask your selected search engine for suggestions based on what you&rsquo;ve typed.</p>

<h3>Safari Suggestions</h3>
<p>Safari search shows you results from the web, iTunes, the App Store, movie showtimes, nearby locations, and more.</p>
<p>When you use Safari Suggestions in Safari, your search queries, the Safari Suggestions you select, and related usage data will be sent to Apple. If you have Location Services on your device turned on, when you make a search query to Safari with Safari Suggestions enabled the location of your device at that time will be sent to Apple. To provide you with more relevant music and video suggestions, if your device can access music or video subscription services, then information such as the names of the subscription services and types of subscriptions may be sent to Apple. Your account name, number and password will not be sent to Apple. Location, search queries, and usage information sent to Apple will only be used by Apple to make Safari Suggestions more relevant and to improve other Apple products and services.</p>
<p>If you do not want your Safari search queries and Safari Suggestions usage data sent to Apple, you can turn off Safari Suggestions. To do so, open Settings, tap Safari and slide the Safari Suggestions switch to &ldquo;off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can turn off Location Services for Safari Suggestions. To do so, open Settings, tap Privacy, tap Location Services, tap System Services, and slide the Location-Based Suggestions switch to &ldquo;off.&rdquo; If you turn off Location Services on your device, your precise location will not be sent to Apple. To deliver relevant search suggestions, Apple may use the IP address of your Internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region.</p>
<p>By using these features, you agree and consent to Apple&rsquo;s and its subsidiaries&rsquo; and agents&rsquo; transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information as described above.</p>
<p>Information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple&rsquo;s Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy">www.apple.com/privacy</a>. Not all features of Safari Suggestions may be available in all languages or regions and some features of Safari Suggestions may vary by region.</p>
