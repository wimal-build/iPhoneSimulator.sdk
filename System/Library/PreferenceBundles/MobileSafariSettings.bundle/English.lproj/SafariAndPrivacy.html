<h3>Asking websites not to track you</h3>
<p>Some websites keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. Safari can ask sites and their third party content providers (including advertisers) not to track you.</p>
<p>With this setting enabled, each time Safari fetches content from a website, Safari adds a request not to track you but it&rsquo;s up to the website to honor this request.</p>

<h3>Block cookies and other website data</h3>
<p>Websites often store cookies and other data on your device. This data may include information that you have provided, such as your name, email address, and your preferences. This data helps websites identify you when you return so the site can provide services for you and show information that might be of interest to you.</p>
<p>By default, Safari accepts cookies and website data only from websites you visit. This helps prevent certain advertisers from storing data on your device. You can change your preferences so that Safari always accepts or always blocks cookies and other website data.</p>

<h3>Fraudulent Website Warning</h3>
<p>When Fraudulent Website Warning is enabled, Safari will display a warning if the site you are visiting is a suspected phishing site. Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to steal your personal information, such as user names, passwords, and other account information. A fraudulent website masquerades as a legitimate one, such as a bank, financial institution or email service provider.</p>

<h3>Private Browsing</h3>
<p>When Private Browsing is enabled, Safari doesn&rsquo;t remember the pages you visit, AutoFill information, and your open tabs aren&rsquo;t stored in iCloud. Safari will also ask sites and their third party content providers (including advertisers) not to track you. Websites can&rsquo;t modify information stored on your device, so services normally available at such sites may work differently until you turn off Private Browsing.</p>
<p>Note: While Private Browsing is enabled, the Safari user interface appears dark instead of light.</p>

<h3>Spotlight Suggestions</h3>
<p>When you use Spotlight Suggestions in Safari, your search queries, the Spotlight Suggestions you select, and related usage data will be sent to Apple. If you have Location Services on your device turned on, when you make a search query to Spotlight the location of your device at that time will be sent to Apple. Location, search queries, and usage information sent to Apple will be used by Apple only to make Spotlight Suggestions more relevant and to improve other Apple products and services.</p>

<p>If you do not want your Safari search queries and Spotlight Suggestions usage data sent to Apple, you can change your privacy settings for Safari at any time. To do so, open Settings, tap Safari, scroll down to Privacy &amp; Security and choose the options you wish to enable or disable.</p>

<p>You can turn off Location Services for Spotlight Suggestions. To do so, open Settings, tap Privacy, tap Location Services, tap System Services, and slide the Spotlight Suggestions switch to “off”. If you turn off Location Services on your device, your precise location will not be sent to Apple. To deliver relevant search suggestions, Apple may use the IP address of your Internet connection to approximate your location by matching it to a geographic region.</p>

<p>Information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be found at <a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy">www.apple.com/privacy</a>.</p>
