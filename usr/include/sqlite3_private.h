** CAPI3REF: The pre-update hook.
**
** ^These interfaces are only available if SQLite is compiled using the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_PREUPDATE_HOOK] compile-time option.
**
** ^The [sqlite3_preupdate_hook()] interface registers a callback function
** that is invoked prior to each [INSERT], [UPDATE], and [DELETE] operation
** on a [rowid table].
** ^At most one preupdate hook may be registered at a time on a single
** [database connection]; each call to [sqlite3_preupdate_hook()] overrides
** the previous setting.
** ^The preupdate hook is disabled by invoking [sqlite3_preupdate_hook()]
** with a NULL pointer as the second parameter.
** ^The third parameter to [sqlite3_preupdate_hook()] is passed through as
** the first parameter to callbacks.
**
** ^The preupdate hook only fires for changes to [rowid tables]; the preupdate
** hook is not invoked for changes to [virtual tables] or [WITHOUT ROWID]
** tables.
**
** ^The second parameter to the preupdate callback is a pointer to
** the [database connection] that registered the preupdate hook.
** ^The third parameter to the preupdate callback is one of the constants
** [SQLITE_INSERT], [SQLITE_DELETE], or [SQLITE_UPDATE] to indentify the
** kind of update operation that is about to occur.
** ^(The fourth parameter to the preupdate callback is the name of the
** database within the database connection that is being modified.  This
** will be "main" for the main database or "temp" for TEMP tables or 
** the name given after the AS keyword in the [ATTACH] statement for attached
** databases.)^
** ^The fifth parameter to the preupdate callback is the name of the
** table that is being modified.
** ^The sixth parameter to the preupdate callback is the initial [rowid] of the
** row being changes for SQLITE_UPDATE and SQLITE_DELETE changes and is
** undefined for SQLITE_INSERT changes.
** ^The seventh parameter to the preupdate callback is the final [rowid] of
** the row being changed for SQLITE_UPDATE and SQLITE_INSERT changes and is
** undefined for SQLITE_DELETE changes.
**
** The [sqlite3_preupdate_old()], [sqlite3_preupdate_new()],
** [sqlite3_preupdate_count()], and [sqlite3_preupdate_depth()] interfaces
** provide additional information about a preupdate event. These routines
** may only be called from within a preupdate callback.  Invoking any of
** these routines from outside of a preupdate callback or with a
** [database connection] pointer that is different from the one supplied
** to the preupdate callback results in undefined and probably undesirable
** behavior.
**
** ^The [sqlite3_preupdate_count(D)] interface returns the number of columns
** in the row that is being inserted, updated, or deleted.
**
** ^The [sqlite3_preupdate_old(D,N,P)] interface writes into P a pointer to
** a [protected sqlite3_value] that contains the value of the Nth column of
** the table row before it is updated.  The N parameter must be between 0
** and one less than the number of columns or the behavior will be
** undefined. This must only be used within SQLITE_UPDATE and SQLITE_DELETE
** preupdate callbacks; if it is used by an SQLITE_INSERT callback then the
** behavior is undefined.  The [sqlite3_value] that P points to
** will be destroyed when the preupdate callback returns.
**
** ^The [sqlite3_preupdate_new(D,N,P)] interface writes into P a pointer to
** a [protected sqlite3_value] that contains the value of the Nth column of
** the table row after it is updated.  The N parameter must be between 0
** and one less than the number of columns or the behavior will be
** undefined. This must only be used within SQLITE_INSERT and SQLITE_UPDATE
** preupdate callbacks; if it is used by an SQLITE_DELETE callback then the
** behavior is undefined.  The [sqlite3_value] that P points to
** will be destroyed when the preupdate callback returns.
**
** ^The [sqlite3_preupdate_depth(D)] interface returns 0 if the preupdate
** callback was invoked as a result of a direct insert, update, or delete
** operation; or 1 for inserts, updates, or deletes invoked by top-level 
** triggers; or 2 for changes resulting from triggers called by top-level
** triggers; and so forth.

** KEYWORDS: {snapshot}
** EXPERIMENTAL
**
** An instance of the snapshot object records the state of a [WAL mode]

**
** In [WAL mode], multiple [database connections] that are open on the
** same database file can each be reading a different historical version

** by the reader until a new read transaction is started.
**
** The sqlite3_snapshot object records state information about an historical
** version of the database file so that it is possible to later open a new read
** transaction that sees that historical version of the database rather than
** the most recent version.
**
